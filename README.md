# 42_Tester_Experiments

## I am trying to build a tester as a side project. I figured I would be learning more about shell scripts and makefiles.
   Currently using the progress bar to make it more fun.
   Lets see ... Anykind of contributions or ideas would be appreciated as I am new to developing.
   
   Thanks to @haikieu for his idea about making a Progress bar. I didn't had to do it from Scratch
   
   Also This is going to be continually updated. When its finished it will be changed to a Tester Finished version

## Current Testing Method
   Clone the repository in your ft_print folder and run the commands      
    
```
   cd my_tester
   bash test.sh
   
```
